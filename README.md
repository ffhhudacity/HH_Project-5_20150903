Improvements made following submission on 2015.09.02 (2015.09.03):

1. Added another location according to the project requirement.
2. The bouncing function is working properly.
3. Revised the css file to add media query for "search-container" so that it is responsive.
4. Didn't change "for...in" just because the entire code is working properly so far, don't want to spend too much time modifying something that doesn't change the end result. But do appreciate reviewer's comment and will implement that for future endeavors. 

Note (2015.09.02):

I realized that in order to fulfill the search filter requirement, I'll have to start with a pre-determined list of places. So after spending tons of time trying to revise my old code, I had to restart a new one, but tried to make it a lot simpler this time.




Instructions on how to use my Neighborhood Map Page. 

	1. Download the GitHub ZIP to your computer and extract the zip file; then you can open index.html in your chrome browser.

	2. Or alternatively, fork the repository, load the index.html into you chrome browser.



Other notes: 

1). I chose to use Foursquare.com to show their top picks on the map, since Foursquare.com is my favorite website to refer to when visiting a new city.

2). on the left to the map shown is a list of four popular coffee shops in Palo Alto, CA.

3). I got a lot of help from my friends who work as a web developer. 

4). Below are some websites that I searched when working on this project.
